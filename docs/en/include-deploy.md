## 快速部署

You can deploy the **{{ page.meta.feature_name }}** feature through Amazon CloudFormation, as described in [**Overview: Deployment Solutions**](deployment.md), and make sure the **{ page.meta.feature _id }}** parameter is set to *yes*. After the deployment is complete, you can view the Nested Stack containing the **{ page.meta.feature_id }** name in the list of stacks in the Amazon CloudFormation console.
